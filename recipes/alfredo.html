             <h2><strong>How To Make It</strong></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>For Cooking Fettuccine</h3></li>
                        <ol>
                    <li><p>In a deep pan or a sauce pan add water and salt.</p><p>Stir.</p></li>
                    <li>Place saucepan on stovetop and bring the water to a boil on high heat.</li>
                    <li><p>Once the water comes to a boil, add the fettuccine pasta or other pasta of choice.</p>
                        <p>Use a spoon to push the fettuccine down into the boiling water as they soften, until fully submerged.</p></li>
                    <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions or until the al dente. <p>That means cooked through but with a slight bite.</p><p>Boil fettuccine on medium to high heat.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Drain the water, making sure to save and set aside about a ½ cup of the cooked pasta water.</p><p>You might want to use a bit to thin out the alfredo sauce.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    <li><h3>Making Alfredo Sauce</h3></li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Meanwhile when the pasta is cooking, begin to make the alfredo sauce. 
                                <p>In a large, deep skillet melt salted or unsalted butter on low heat.</p>
                                <p> If using salted butter you’ll want to add less salt to finish the dish.</p></li>
                            <li>Once the butter has melted, add chopped garlic. 
                                <p>Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of garlic goes away.</p>
                                <p>There is no need to brown the garlic.</p></li>
                            <li>Add the whipping cream. 
                                <p>Mix well with a wired whisk.</p>
                                <p>Bring the cream to a gentle boil on low heat.</p></li>
                            <li>With a whisk continuously stir as you bring the cream mixture to a low simmer on a low heat. 
                                <p>Keep an eye on the cream to ensure it does not get burnt or brown.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Once the cream begins to gently boil, further simmer for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat, until the cream thickens a bit.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Add grated vegetarian parmesan cheese to the cream and mix well.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    <li><h3>Making The Dish <em>(finally right?)</em></h3></li>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Add the cooked and drained pasta to the prepared alfredo sauce in the pan</p></li>
                            <li><p>With the help of tongs thoroughly mix the pasta and sauce together, so that every pasta is coated in the creamy Alfredo.</p></li>
                            <li>Continue to cook the fettuccine alfredo on low heat for another minute or two, stirring frequently to keep the pasta from sticking or clumping together. 
                                <p>If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water, and stir to combine.</p></li>
                            <li>Taste the dish, and season with salt as needed and crushed black pepper. 
                               <p>I also recommend adding a dash of freshly grated nutmeg.</p></li>
                            <li>Mix again, and turn off the heat.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><h4>Serving and Storage</h4></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Serve the pasta hot.</p>
                                            <p>Garnish fettuccine alfredo with grated vegetarian parmesan cheese and chopped parsley or soft fresh herb of your choice.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator.</p>
                                            <p>While reheating, add a bit of water or milk to thin the consistency slightly.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
