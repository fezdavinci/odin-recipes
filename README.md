first project from top to practice html
This is my very first go at a site using html. Time to put the skills and knowledge i've learnt to test. We will fill in with css and java and whatever else the project in TOP says at a later time. For now lets focus on the basics, HTML. 
This should be fun to learn to do, once i get git down lol.
